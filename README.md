# Source_Code_Eval
An R program which takes a code source file, and outputs relevant statistics.


[Work in Progress]
***
### File Use and Specifics
Any source code file can be taken in, and simply read as a txt file. From there, a dictionary of words and how many times they are used is created.

I have not created what will be outputted yet. but I plan to output most words used, most functions used, and most likely a few other interesting statistics.

From there, the info will be output to a file, at the users command, with information from every other code file run through this program. Hopefully, I will be able to compare the changes that are made in the code in relation to older code from the same user.
